# Fruits_Classifier
This is a trained model for identifying multiple fruit classes.
Replace the path in "fruit_detect.ipymb" file and put the path with your own image file.
You can retrain the model for better results.
Use cuda enabled GPU which decreases the training time.
Refer the "label_1.txt" for getting the classes of fruits along with their names.
